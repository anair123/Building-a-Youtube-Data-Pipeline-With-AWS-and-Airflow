The goal of the project is to create a data pipeline that collects YouTube data for the 5 countries with the most YouTube users: Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and the United States. This pipeline should collect data on a daily basis in order to keep the information up to date.

The data collected with the pipeline will be used to answer the following questions:

What are the most popular video categories in each country?
Does the most popular video category change over time? If so, how?
